Upgrading your site's PHP Version will improve the security, performance and supportability of your site. Check out our blog post for an [example of 20% performance gains after upgrading](https://pantheon.io/blog/choose-your-own-php-adventure-php-55-now-available-20-performance-gains).

## Upgrading Your PHP Version

<div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert">
<strong>Note</strong>: Running different versions of PHP per environment is risky and should only be done while you resolve compatibility issues. If you are not working on PHP version compatibility specifically, you should restore all environments to the default value.
</div>

1. From the Site Dashboard, click **Settings** >> **PHP version**.
2. Temporarily set Dev or Multidev environment to the newer version of PHP.

3. Resolve any PHP version compatibility issues or warnings in Dev or Multidev environment
4. Temporarily set Test to the newer version of PHP and deploy there for a final check.
5. Set the **Site Default** to the newer version and deploy your compatibility changes (if any) to Live.
6. Restore all environments to `Site Default` to ensure they remain the same and youâ€™re ready for the next update.

## Resolving PHP Version Compatibility Issues

We recommend working with theme, module or plugin maintainers to resolve any issues upstream. For custom code, see the  *Backward Incompatible Changes* documentation for migrating from one PHP Version to another at [http://php.net/manual/en/appendices.php](http://php.net/manual/en/appendices.php).
